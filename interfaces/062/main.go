// Interfaces - Intro

// An interface type in Go is kind of like a definition. It defines and describes the exact methods that some other type must have.
// Interfaces are a concept that at first may need some time to be understood, take all your time.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// This first exercise we are going to create an interface, no execution!
// Creating our first interface:
// declare an interface called "Geometry"

	// create a function signature area(), it's return type will be float64
	


// A rectangle struct
type rect struct {
    width, height float64
}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	doSomething(ctx)
}
